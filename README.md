# Microcontrollers

Learning about Microcontrollers

- Embedded Systems: Microcontrollers are the heart of embedded systems. They are small, low-cost, low-power, self-contained computer designed to control a specific function. They are used in everyday devices like microwave ovens, washing machines, and cars. They are also used in industrial machines, medical devices, and scientific instruments.

- Program: Microcontrollers are programmed to perform a specific task. They are programmed using a high-level language like C or assembly language. The program is stored in the microcontroller's memory and executed when the microcontroller is powered on.

- IDE - Editor, Compiler and Debugger

- Microcontroller: A microcontroller is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. It contains a processor core, memory, and input/output peripherals. The processor core executes the program stored in memory, and the input/output peripherals interface with the external world.

## Binary Numbers

- Binary Numbers: Microcontrollers use binary numbers to represent data. A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically 0 (zero) and 1 (one). For example, the binary number 1011 is equivalent to the decimal number 11.

- There are a couple of different way that you can indicate that a number is in binary instead of
decimal.
 Use a suffix of B: 1010B
 Use a suffix of b: 1010b
 Use a suffix of 2: 1010<sub>2</sub>

| Decimal | Binary  |
|---------|---------|
| 0       | 0       |
| 1       | 1       |
| 2       | 10      |
| 3       | 11      |
| 4       | 100     |
| 5       | 101     |
| 6       | 110     |
| 7       | 111     |
| 8       | 1000    |
| 9       | 1001    |
| 10      | 1010    |
| 11      | 1011    |
| 12      | 1100    |
| 13      | 1101    |
| 14      | 1110    |
| 15      | 1111    |
| 16      | 10000   |

- To convert a decimal number into binary, use the Short Division by Two with Remainder method. 

- let us convert a number from binary to decimal. To do this, we will use the Position Notation Method. This method is very powerful and is used by most designers when working with binary numbers. It makes use of the powers of 2.

## Hexadecimal Numbers

# Arduino
The Arduino is a popular microcontroller board that is used by hobbyists, students, and professionals to build a wide range of projects. It is based on the Atmel AVR microcontroller and comes with a simple programming environment that allows you to write, compile, and upload code to the board.

The difference between mircrocontroller is it runs at execution speed of 16MHz and has 32KB of flash memory, 2KB of SRAM, and 1KB of EEPROM. It is good for handling hardware low level task. While a microprocessor is a general-purpose processor that is used in computers and other devices. It runs at a much higher execution speed of 2 GHz and has more memory 8 GB and processing power than a microcontroller. It is good for high computation power tasks.
